# first module with name "sourceImage"
# using the module "loadImage" which is able to read an image file and provides one output
# it has the parameter filename which refers to the file that it should read
- sourceImage:
    module: loadImage
    filename: myImage.png

# second module's name is "process", module names are unique btw.
# here the module "gaussian" is used, which has a paramter kernelSize
# the gaussian module has an input named "image" which is of type Image
# and is configured to take the value of the "image" output of the
# sourceImage module configured above.
- process:
    module: gaussian
    kernelSize: 5
    input:
      - image: sourceImage.image

# the last module in the chain is named "output" and uses the storeImage module
# which saves the input into a file
- output:
    module: storeImage
    input:
      - image: process.image
    filename: output.png
